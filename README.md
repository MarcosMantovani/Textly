# Textly - Text and Image-Based Social Network

## Description
Textly is a text and image-based social network inspired by platforms like Twitter. Users can create profiles, edit their information (name, username, profile picture, banner, and biography), follow other users, create posts with text and images, reply to posts, edit and delete their own posts, search for posts and users using keywords, and recover their password if forgotten. This project is a Full Stack application built with **Python** on the backend, **TypeScript** and **React** on the frontend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database.

## Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yaml` file defines three services: `db`, `backend`, and `frontend`.

### Services
- **db**: PostgreSQL database service.
- **backend**: Django backend service. It handles migrations and runs the Django application using Gunicorn.
- **frontend**: React frontend service. It builds and serves the frontend application.

### Networks
- All services are connected to a custom bridge network named `django_network`.

### Volumes
- A volume named `postgres_data` is used to persist PostgreSQL data.

- A volume named `media` is used to persist images.
